# What is this metric?

Staking Pool Stake Weight tracks the amount of staked ETH controlled by a pooling service. Staking Pools are any service, centralized or decentralized, that takes ETH from multiple holders and runs validators on their behalf. The value of this metric is the percentage of ETH not operating out of the largest staking pool.


# Why is it important?

A low Staking Pool Stake Weight percentage means a dangerously large amount of staked ETH is controlled by a single entity. Mistakes in technical execution or potential business continuity issues can threaten the security and finality of the entire network. This also creates a single point of failure for malicious actors to attack, takeover, or disrupt the network. 


# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about staking pool diversity. Fund projects that make solo staking easier or help start up different decentralized staking solutions.
- **Stakers** - Solo stake when possible. Pool your ETH with minority pooling services or spread your staked ETH across multiple pools.
- **Developers** - Continually develop and support multiple decentralized staking pools to avoid one or two dominant decentralized pools from emerging.
