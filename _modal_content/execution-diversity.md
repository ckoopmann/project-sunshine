# What is this metric?

Execution Client Diversity tracks the breakdown of validators by execution. The value of this metric is determined by the combined market share of minority clients.


# Why is it important?

Single client dominance creates security and financial risks for both that client's node operators and the chain itself. A bug in a supermajority client can create potential finality issues for the entire chain, whether that is creating bad blocks or forking the chain.


# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about client diversity. Fund minority client teams and projects that promote a multi-client network.
- **Governance Entities** - Maintain a reasonable diversity of clients across your pool of validators and support projects that prioritize client diversity.
- **Developers** - Continually develop and support multiple clients to avoid one or two dominant clients from emerging.

- [Eth-Docker](https://eth-docker.net/) - A Docker environment that makes setup simple and switching between clients even easier.
- [Rocket Pool](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/) - A non-custodial decentralized staking pool focused on client diversity that allows you to stake with as little as 0.01 ETH or run your own validator with only 16 ETH.
