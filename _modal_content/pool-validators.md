# What is this metric?

Non-Pool Validators tracks the number of validators that are operated by staking pool services. The value of this metric is the percent market share of validators not operated by a staking pool.


# Why is it important?

One (or a small group of) staking pools controlling the majority of staked ETH weakens the decentralization of the network. This presents a security issue where an otherwise one-off issue gets spread unto the majority of the network. Staking pools also create a single point of failure for bad actors, internal or external, to target and disrupt the network. 


# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about the dangers of large staking pools dominating the amount of ETH staked. Push potential stakers to consider solo staking or decentralized staking solutions, such as Rocket Pool.
- **Solo Stakers** - Continue solo staking, preferably avoiding data centers and using your own infrastructure, or stake with Rocket Pool which will enable more bandwidth for the protocol. 
- **Pool Stakers** - Switch to decentralized staking pools like Rocket Pool, use less dominant staking pools, or spread ETH across multiple staking pools.
- **DAOs** - Support projects and research that aim to decentralize staking pools. 
- **DeFi Teams** - Integrate your platform with decentralized staking projects to grow and incentivize the decentralized network effects.
