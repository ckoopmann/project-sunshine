# What is this metric?

Non-Hosted Validators tracks the breakdown of validators operated at home vs a data center. The value of this metric is the percentage of validators not operated out of a data center (aka non-hosted).


# Why is it important?

Nodes that rely on cloud hosted services create a single point of failure or attack that can affect many nodes at once. Interrupted service to a single hosting site can stop otherwise functional validators, threatening finality of the network. A concentration of nodes running on one cloud hosting service creates an easy target for malicious actors to attack, takeover, or disrupt the network.


# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about the importance of non-cloud hosted nodes to the decentralization of the Ethereum network. 
- **Solo Stakers** - Switch to non-cloud hosted nodes and use tools like Eth-Docker or Rocket Pool that make it easy to setup and manage your node. 
- **Pool Stakers** - Continually improve accessibility for stakers to self host a node.
- **Governance Entities** - Support projects that are making self-hosting easier.
