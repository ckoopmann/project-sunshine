# What is this metric?

Consensus Client Count tracks consensus client implementations. The value of this metric is how many primary open source consensus client implementations exist.


# Why is it important?

Having only a single client implementation creates security and financial risks for node operators and the chain itself. A bug in any single client can create potential finality issues for the entire chain, whether that is creating bad blocks or forking the chain. More clients and a diverse client marketshare greatly reduces the risk of a bug in any single client.


# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about client diversity. Fund minority client teams and projects that promote a multi-client network.
- **Governance Entities** - Help fund client dev teams and multi-client tools for public good initiatives.
- **Developers** - Continually develop and support existing clients to avoid less dominant clients getting left behind.
