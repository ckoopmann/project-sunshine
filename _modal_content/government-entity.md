# What is this metric?

Government Entity Stake Weight tracks the amount of staked ETH controlled by a governance entity. Governance Entities are providers, centralized or decentralized, that have decision making control over staked ETH. The value of this metric is the percentage of staked ETH not controlled by the top Government Entity.


# Why is it important?

A low Government Entity Stake Weight percentage means a dangerously large amount of staked ETH is controlled by a single entity. Mistakes in technical execution or potential business continuity issues can threaten the security and finality of the entire network. This also creates a single point of failure for malicious actors to attack, takeover, or disrupt the network. Government Entities can also exert political or social pressure to further grow their market share dominance.


# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about Government Entity diversity. Fund projects that make solo staking easier.
- **Stakers** - Solo stake when possible. Pool your ETH with minority pooling services or spread your staked ETH across multiple pools. 
- **Governance Entities** - Create an internal management or DAO structure that limits the amount of control any one person / small group of people have over decision making.
